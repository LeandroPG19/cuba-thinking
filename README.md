## Why Cuba-Thinking?

AI agents think in flat, unstructured sequences. Cuba-Thinking gives them:

- **6-stage cognitive engine** — Bloom's Taxonomy state machine: DEFINE → RESEARCH → ANALYZE → HYPOTHESIZE → VERIFY → SYNTHESIZE
- **9-layer anti-hallucination** — Assumption tracking, confidence calibration, CoVe structure, evidence accumulation, claim grounding (per-claim proximity), EWMA threshold enforcement, contradiction detection, warmup guard, anti-overthinking
- **6D quality metrics** — Clarity (TTR), Depth (clause counting), Breadth (noun diversity), Logic (connective density), Relevance (TF-IDF cosine), Actionability (imperative + specificity)
- **Process Reward Model (PRM)** — 7-signal code evaluation: Compiles, Asserts Pass, Complexity, Type Safety, Safe Imports, Determinism, Coverage
- **Sandboxed execution** — PyO3 sandbox with PEP 578 audit hooks, ReDoS guard, Z3 vacuous truth detector, and AST-level import blocking
- **MCTS forced backtracking** — Protocol-level rejection (`isError: true`) when EWMA drops below budget-aware threshold, with hedged rejection zones
- **Graph-of-Thought (GoT)** — DAG topology tracking with Tarjan SCC cycle detection O(V+E) for circular reasoning (petitio principii)
- **Persistent thought sessions** — Cross-call state accumulation: EWMA, novelty, graph, confidence oscillation, depth degradation, root-anchoring, hypothesis drift
- **Epistemological rollback** — Snapshot/rollback of session state when MCTS rejects a thought, preventing hallucinated premises from poisoning future reasoning
- **Bias detection** — Identifies 5 cognitive biases (Anchoring, Confirmation, Availability, Sunk Cost, Bandwagon)
- **Metacognitive analysis** — Filler ratio, content-word ratio, claim density, fallacy detection, dialectical reasoning checks
- **Corrective directives** — Actionable improvement suggestions targeting weak quality dimensions
- **Cross-MCP memory symbiosis** — Bridge to [cuba-memorys](https://github.com/lENADRO1910/cuba-memorys) for recall/consolidation
- **EWMA reward tracking** — 6-signal composite with adaptive α floor, MACD collapse prediction, Process Advantage Verifier (PAV), and stagnation/fatigue detection
- **Contradiction detection** — Direct negation, antonym pairs, quantifier conflicts with sentence context
- **Novelty tracking** — Information gain per thought step via Jaccard distance on TF vectors
- **Depth degradation** — Tracks quality.depth history per thought, detects >50% drop vs baseline (KV cache saturation proxy)
- **Code-aware metrics** — Quality, depth, and directives adapt when input is code vs natural language
- **Anti-overthinking** — Stagnation detection, fatigue monitoring, early stopping signals

## The 6 Cognitive Stages

Based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001):

```
DEFINE ──→ RESEARCH ──→ ANALYZE ──→ HYPOTHESIZE ──→ VERIFY ──→ SYNTHESIZE
  📋          🔍          🔬           💡             ✅          🎯
```

| Stage | Focus | Confidence Range | Boosted Dimension |
|-------|-------|:----------------:|:-----------------:|
| DEFINE | Clarify scope, requirements | 0.30 – 0.60 | Clarity (3×) |
| RESEARCH | Explore options, gather data | 0.30 – 0.70 | Breadth (3×) |
| ANALYZE | Evaluate trade-offs, compare | 0.40 – 0.80 | Depth (3×) |
| HYPOTHESIZE | Propose solutions, predict | 0.50 – 0.85 | Logic (3×) |
| VERIFY | Test, validate, confirm | 0.60 – 0.90 | Logic (3×) |
| SYNTHESIZE | Conclude, recommend, summarize | 0.70 – 0.95 | Actionability (3×) |

---

## 9-Layer Anti-Hallucination

Zero LLM calls. All verification runs locally:

| # | Layer | Method |
|:-:|-------|--------|
| 1 | **Assumption Tracking** | Dedup across all thoughts |
| 2 | **Confidence Calibration** | Per-stage expected ranges, delta tracking |
| 3 | **Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)** | Self-verification patterns (Dhuliawala et al., 2023) |
| 4 | **Evidence Accumulation** | Flags unsupported confidence increases (Wald, 1945) |
| 5 | **Claim Counter** | Verifiable assertions per sentence |
| 6 | **Source Grounding** | Per-claim proximity check — evidence in ±1 adjacent sentences |
| 7 | **EWMA Threshold** | Budget-aware MCTS rejection with hedged rejection zone (V5) |
| 8 | **Contradiction Flag** | Internal contradiction detection |
| 9 | **Warmup Guard** | Suppress false alarms for thoughts 1–2 |

**Anti-Overthinking (R10):** Detects stagnation (3+ similar EWMA) and fatigue (3+ consecutive drops). Triggers early stopping signals.

**Trust Score:**

```text
trust = quality×0.40 + evidence×0.20 + grounding×0.20 + calibrated×0.10 + ewma_ok×0.10
```

---

## MCTS Forced Backtracking

When the EWMA step reward drops below the budget-aware threshold (after thought #3), the tool call is **rejected at protocol level** with `isError: true`:

```text
Budget thresholds (UCB1 — Kocsis & Szepesvári, 2006):
  fast:       50%  (exploit — cut losses early)
  balanced:   40%  (default)
  thorough:   35%
  exhaustive: 30%  (explore — give chains room)
```

**Hedged Rejection (V5):** Instead of a binary threshold, uses a stochastic rejection zone around the MCTS threshold to prevent output engineering. Probability of rejection increases proportionally as EWMA approaches the threshold.

---

## EWMA Step Reward — Roberts (1959)

6-signal composite with adaptive α floor:

```text
EWMA_t = α · reward_t + (1 - α) · EWMA_{t-1}
α = max(2/(n+1), α_floor)    — budget-aware floor

reward = 0.40·quality + 0.20·faithfulness + 0.10·coherence
       + 0.10·(1 - contradiction_rate) + 0.10·info_gain + 0.10·grounding
```

- **Reward history**: Capped at 20 entries (VecDeque ring buffer)
- **Stagnation detection**: 3+ steps with <2% EWMA change
- **Fatigue detection**: 3+ consecutive quality drops
- **MACD collapse prediction**: Convergence/divergence signal for early detection of quality collapse
- **Process Advantage Verifier (PAV)**: Measures advantage over baseline, penalizes "vacuous depth" (deep reasoning without real content)

---

## Graph-of-Thought (GoT)

DAG topology tracking across reasoning chains with cycle detection:

- **Nodes**: Each thought step becomes a node
- **Edges**: Sequential and revision dependencies
- **Convergence**: Multiple paths merging (in-degree > 1)
- **Revisions**: Explicit thought revision tracking
- **Cycle detection**: Tarjan's SCC algorithm O(V+E) detects circular reasoning (petitio principii: "X because Y" + "Y because X")
- **TopologySummary**: Nodes, edges, depth, convergence, revisions, orphans, cycle_count

---

## Persistent Thought Sessions

Sessions maintain state across multiple MCP tool calls sharing the same hypothesis:

- **EWMA accumulation**: Quality tracking persists across calls
- **Novelty tracking**: Vocabulary grows across calls
- **Graph-of-Thought**: DAG builds across calls
- **Trend indicator**: ↗️ Improving, → Stable, ↘️ Declining (based on EWMA history)
- **Hypothesis drift (G11)**: Semantic distance from original hypothesis
- **Root-anchoring**: Combined drift detection (hypothesis + first thought)
- **Confidence oscillation**: Detects rapidly alternating confidence (>3 sign changes in 5 readings)
- **Depth degradation (V6)**: Tracks quality.depth history, detects >50% drop vs baseline (first 3 thoughts) — indicates KV cache saturation
- **Epistemological rollback (V5)**: Snapshot/rollback when MCTS rejects a thought — physically removes dead branch state from thoughts, confidence_history, depth_history, and graph
- **Auto-expire**: TTL 600s to prevent memory leaks

---

## Sandbox Security

Multi-layered Python sandbox via PyO3:

| Layer | Protection |
|-------|------------|
| **AST Scanner** | Blocks dangerous imports at parse time (os.system, subprocess, etc.) |
| **PEP 578 Audit Hooks** (V5) | Blocks OS-level events at runtime (os.exec*, subprocess, ctypes, shutil, webbrowser) |
| **ReDoS Guard** (V5) | Monkey-patches `re.compile` with backreference length limit (idempotent) |
| **Z3 Vacuous Truth** (V5) | Detects vacuous truths and trivial assertions in Z3 solver outputs |

---

## Contradiction Detection

Three-signal heuristic pipeline:

1. **Direct Negation** — Detects "not X" vs "X" across sentences with shared context
2. **Antonym Pairs** — 20 antonym pairs (fast/slow, increase/decrease, etc.)
3. **Quantifier Conflicts** — Universal vs existential quantifiers (all/none, always/never)

Internal contradictions (within a single thought) also detected via sentence-pair analysis.

---

## Metacognitive Analysis

| Metric | Method | Warning Threshold |
|--------|--------|:-----------------:|
| Filler Ratio | Filler words / total words | > 30% |
| Content-Word Ratio | Non-function words / total (LazyLock) | < 40% |
| Claim Density | Verifiable assertions per sentence | Informational |
| Fallacy Detection | Hasty Generalization, False Dichotomy | Any detected |
| Dialectical Check | Counter-arguments in VERIFY/SYNTHESIZE | Missing |

---

## Bias Detection

| Bias | Detection Method |
|------|-----------------|
| **Anchoring** | Over-reliance on first-mentioned data |
| **Confirmation** | Only seeking supporting evidence |
| **Availability** | Reliance on recent/memorable examples |
| **Sunk Cost** | Defending prior decisions despite evidence |
| **Bandwagon** | "Everyone uses X" reasoning |

Each detected bias includes confidence level, explanation, and actionable suggestion.

---

## Memory Symbiosis

Cross-MCP bridge to [cuba-memorys](https://github.com/lENADRO1910/cuba-memorys):

| Stage | Trigger | Injected Instruction |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **DEFINE** (thought ≤ 2) | Problem definition | `cuba_faro(query:...)` — search past knowledge |
| | | `cuba_expediente(query:...)` — check past errors |
| **SYNTHESIZE** (!nextThought) | Conclusion | `cuba_cronica(action:"add", ...)` — consolidate lesson |

Analogous to the cortex-hippocampus consolidation cycle (McClelland et al., 1995).

---

## Budget Modes

| Mode | EWMA α Floor | MCTS Threshold | Max Thoughts |
|------|:------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| ⚡ `fast` | 0.30 | 50% | 5 |
| ⚖️ `balanced` | 0.25 | 40% | 10 |
| 🔎 `thorough` | 0.20 | 35% | 20 |
| 🔬 `exhaustive` | 0.15 | 30% | 50 |
